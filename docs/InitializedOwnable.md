**InitializedOwnable**

Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
specific functions.
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
`onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
the owner.

## Contract Members
**Constants & Variables**

```js
address private _owner;

```

**Events**

```js
event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);
```

## Modifiers

- [onlyOwner](#onlyowner)

### onlyOwner

Throws if called by any account other than the owner.

```js
modifier onlyOwner() internal
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

## Functions

- [initOwnership()](#initownership)
- [owner()](#owner)
- [isOwner()](#isowner)
- [renounceOwnership()](#renounceownership)
- [transferOwnership(address newOwner)](#transferownership)
- [_transferOwnership(address newOwner)](#_transferownership)

### initOwnership

Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner.

```js
function initOwnership() internal nonpayable
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### owner

Returns the address of the current owner.

```js
function owner() public view
returns(address)

### isOwner

Returns true if the caller is the current owner.

returns(bool)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |

### renounceOwnership

Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call
`onlyOwner` functions anymore. Can only be called by the current owner.
     * NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner,
thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.

```js
function renounceOwnership() public nonpayable onlyOwner 
```

| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| newOwner | address |  | 

### _transferOwnership
